        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        B+ trees offer significant value by providing efficient data retrieval in block-oriented storage applications like file
        systems and databases. A B+ tree is nothing more than a tree (with a particularly high fanout or order, which we shall
        refer to as m) that satisfies the following conditions:
        
        An internal node (nodes that aren't the root or leaves) must have a number of children d such that ⌈m/2⌉ ≤ d ≤ m
        The root node may have at least 2 children and up to m children
        The number of keys k that an internal node may carry is ⌈m/2⌉ - 1 ≤ k ≤ m - 1
        Leaf nodes have no children, but the number of dictionary pairs k that a single leaf node may carry is ⌈m/2⌉ - 1 ≤ k ≤ m
        - 1
        A B+ tree is similar to a B tree except that all the dictionary pairs lie in the leaf nodes.
        </p>

        <h3>Here is the impl of B+ trees <a href="https://github.com/Adarshsidnal/">Click Here</a></h3>
        <p>For the program to work properly, ensure that the input_file follows the format:
        
        The first line must contain Initialize(m) where m is the order of the B+ tree
        All subsequent lines may contain only the following operations:
        Insert(key, value) where key is an integer and value is a floating point number
        Delete(key) where key is the key of the dictionary pair you would like to delete
        Search(key) where key is the key of the dictionary pair whose value you would like to find
        Search(lowerBound, upperBound) where all values of dictionary pairs whose keys fall within lowerBound ≤ key ≤ upperBound
        will be recorded
        Output for each search query will be recorded within a file titled output_file.txt.
